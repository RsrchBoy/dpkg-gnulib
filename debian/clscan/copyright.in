> The files in here are mostly copyright (C) Free Software Foundation, and

>
> Many modules are provided dual-license, either GPL or LGPL at your
> option.  The headers of files in the lib directory (e.g., lib/error.c)
> state GPL for convenience, since the bulk of current gnulib users are
> GPL'd programs.  But the files in the modules directory (e.g.,
> modules/error) state the true license of each file, and when you use
> 'gnulib-tool --lgpl --import <modules>', gnulib-tool either rewrites
> the files to have an LGPL header as part of copying them from gnulib
> to your project directory, or fails because the modules you requested
> were not licensed under LGPL.
>
> Some of the source files in lib/ have different licenses.  Also, the
> copy of maintain.texi in doc/ has a verbatim-copying license, and
> doc/standards.texi and make-stds.texi are GFDL.
