#	posixtm: don't reject a time that specify "60" as the number of seconds
#	* lib/posixtm.c (posixtime): The code to reject invalid dates
#	would also reject a time specified with the .60 suffix.
#	But POSIX allows that, in order to accommodate leap seconds.
#	So don't reject it.
#	(main): Adjust tests accordingly.
#	* modules/posixtm (Depends-on): Add stpcpy.
#
#2009-09-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>
#
#	announce-gen: include [$release_type] in emitted Subject:
#	* build-aux/announce-gen (get_tool_versions): Include [$release_type],
#	e.g., [stable] in the emitted Subject: line.
